# Lane-Detection-MATLAB
This MATLAB code shows how lanes can be detected on a video from a car moving on the high way. The code uses MATLAB interfaces like canny edge detection and Hough transform for detecting lanes on the Highway.
The Region of Interest code helps selecting the points for the region of interest and getting the necessary coordinates for the main prgram to work.
